The first method that I am thinking about is the devision tree which is because the character is easy to be find 

Here is a record of method that I used in this competiton:
# Dealt with data
This is how we dealing with data:
```
def data_clean(df):
    df_copy = df.copy()
    df_copy.drop(columns=['q21','q22'], axis=0, inplace=True)
# we delete the part 'q21' and 'q22', this is the second part of this problem. 
    df_copy = pd.get_dummies(df_copy, columns=['q1','q2'])
    df_copy = df_copy.astype(int)
# Here we do the one-hot encoding. 
    print(df_copy.head())
    return df_copy

def test_train_data(df_train):
    y = df_train['label']
# Then let's do the one-hot encoding for label, y 
    X = df_train.drop(columns=['label'], axis=1)
    y_adjusted = y - 1
    y = to_categorical(y_adjusted, num_classes=6)
# Seperate the data 
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    sc = StandardScaler()
    X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = sc.transform(X_test)
    
    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
```
Here in this project what we are doing is we first use the **one-hot encoding method** to achieve the problem that in the questionaire that:

Please share all of the reasons you chose to attend the TAPS [SEMINAR NAME]
0. I had attended a previous Regional or Nationals seminar
1. To connect with other survivors who share a similar loss 
2. To learn more about resources TAPS has to offer 
3. To learn new tools and information to help me with my grief
4. To learn more about how to support my adult family members in their grief
5. To learn more about how to support my child(ren) in their grief 
6. For my child(ren) to attend Good Grief Camp
7. For my child(ren) to connect with a Military Mentor 

How did you find out about the TAPS [SEMINAR NAME]?
0. I found this event while searching for grief resources 
1. I attended a seminar last year and had already marked my calendar! 
2. TAPS invited me to this event via email 
3. My TAPS Survivor Care Team Member invited me
4. My Peer Mentor or another survivor invited me 
5. Through the TAPS website 
6. Through the TAPS magazine 
7. Through a TAPS Social Media Page

Then we find this is no nummerical relationships between each option.
# CarBoost:

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score


# 选择特征(X)和标签(y)
X = df.iloc[:, 2:21]  # 选择第2列到第20列作为特征
y = df['label']  # 选择'label'列作为标签

# 将特征分为数值型和分类型
cat_features = X.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns.tolist()

kf = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True)

# 存储每次折叠的准确率

# 进行K折交叉验证
for fold, (train_index, val_index) in enumerate(kf.split(X), 1):
    X_train, X_val = X.iloc[train_index], X.iloc[val_index]
    y_train, y_val = y.iloc[train_index], y.iloc[val_index]

# ANN

Here we use two types of ANN, a good example is CNN
